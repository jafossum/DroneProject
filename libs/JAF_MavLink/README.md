# JAF_MavLink

[MavLink](http://www.qgroundcontrol.org/mavlink/start) based library containing my own implementation 
of the MavLink protocoll using the MavLink [mavgenerate](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink) for C++ 
projects.

This will be an ongoing project with MavLink methods added as they are needed into my own MavLink definition 
files.
